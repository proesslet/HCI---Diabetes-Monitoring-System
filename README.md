# DiabetesMonitoringSystem

This application is a diabetes monitoring system that allows users to record their current blood sugar level and it will inform them whether it is high, low, or normal. If it is high or low, it tells them what steps to take to bring their blood sugar levels back to normal.

Note: This application was created for a Human Computer Interaction course. It is a simplified version of most diabetes monitoring systems and should not be user for real health purposes.
